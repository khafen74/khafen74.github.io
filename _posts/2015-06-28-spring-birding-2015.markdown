The truth is, I used to make fun of birders. Now I am one. My wife and I find birding a good way to get outside and enjoy the outdoors when we don't have enough time to get out and do a hike, when I don't feel like fishing, and when it's not hunting season. Also, there are a lot of neat bird species with interesting habits and beautiful features. No matter where you live there are probably quite a few species of birds available for you to watch, and you will eventually see something interesting. 

We have a few go-to spots around Logan area. Wetlands and riparian areas always host a diversity of species. When we have the time we make the 45 minute drive the Bear River Bird refuge. Here are some photos of the birds we've observed during the spring of this year. 

I had never seen Sandhill Cranes do a courtship dance before, it's pretty entertaining and had us chuckling as we watched. Don't worry we recorded it so you could enjoy it as well!

This Sandhill Crane was harassed by a Red-winged Blackbird, I only caught the tail-end of their interaction, but it was pretty entertaining to watch. The crane seemed a little distressed and even picked up some vegetation in its bill and tossed it around.

As always there were plenty of Yellow-headed and Red-winged blackbirds around. We managed to get a few pictures. I especially like the one Chalese captured of all the Yellow-headed Blackbirds on an old gate at the bird refuge.

One evening we were at the bird refuge later than we had stayed before. The last little while we were there a lot of the birds were going to sleep. One of the best views we had all day was of these American Avocets with heads tucked under wings.

Another occasion, near Logan, Chalese mentioned she wanted to see a Wilson's Snipe before we left the house. While fairly common, the snipe is often hard to find because they like to hang out on the ground in tall grass and have very cryptic coloration. So, while their song is frequently heard, it is somewhat of a rarity to see one. Well what do we find? A snipe sitting out in the open on a fence post, right next to the road.

During the spring we also saw a lot of Western Grebes, this one has a new chick riding on its back, and Cattle Egrets.

One afternoon we saw a surprising number of Pied-billed Grebes and Long-billed Curlews.
