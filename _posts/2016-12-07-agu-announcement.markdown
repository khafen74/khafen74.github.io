Next week (December 12-16) I will be atttending the AGU Fall Meeting at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. 
On the last day of the meeting I will be presenting a poster on my [beaver dam modeling research](http://khafen74.github.io/projects/899_BeaverPondSurfaceStorage.html) this poster will be part of the Ecohydrologic and Ecogeomorphologic Processes at the Intersection of Landscapes and Environmental Change II poster session. 
The session is in the Moscone South poster hall from 1:40p - 6:00p, I will be at the poster to present and answer questions from 2p - 4p and should be close by the rest of the afternoon.
If you are at the conference and are interested, please stop by! It would be great to talk science with you. 
Exact details for my presentation can be found at the link below.
