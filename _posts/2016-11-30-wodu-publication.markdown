This is the result of my final undergraduate project. We monitored artifical Wood Duck nest boxes in Cache Valley, Utah for three years and used the data to address causes of conspecific brood parasitism.

Our analyses focus on the attributes of habitat and nest boxes that may result in increased levels of conspecific brood parasitism in artificially nesting wood duck populations. 
Our results indicate that nest boxes mounted on trees have a lower proabability of experiencing conspecific brood parasitsm regardless of surrounding habitat or nest box density.
