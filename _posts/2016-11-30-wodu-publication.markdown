Another paper coming out of some undergraduate work. We examined two populations of moose in Utah, one of which is the southernmost occurance of moose in the lower 48.

Our analyses focus on the nutrition of moose in these populations and a comparison of our study populations to others in the U.S.A. and Canada along a latitudinal gradient.
