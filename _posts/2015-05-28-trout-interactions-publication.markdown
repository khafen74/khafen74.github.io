As an undergraduate I devoted a fair amount of time to extracurricular activities, among those was research. 
I participated in several research projects, some minor, others more involved. 
One of my studies was to examine aggression between Tiger, Rainbow, and Cutthroat trout to investigate how aggression could be affecting the interactions between the species when they are stocked together in reservoirs. 
I won't spoil the ending, take a look at the links below for more.

You can get a summary of the study [here](http://khafen74.github.io) or read the [abstract](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02755947.2015.1017126) or [full text](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02755947.2015.1017126) of the published article.
An accepted [PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277720383_Agonistic_Behavior_among_Three_Stocked_Trout_Species) version is also available.
More information on the greater trout study can be found in this [report](http://www.usu.edu/fel/research/scofield-reservoir/USUBudy_2013ComplRept_Scofield_2April2014.pdf).
