Birding in the winter is definitely a little more daunting than in the spring summer or fall. We mostly saw a lot of raptors and goldeneyes, but also had a close up view of some swans.

Watching this Swainson's Hawk have a little snack was a treat for us (pun intended).

We were really surprised to see these two swans hanging out at a small reservoir in Logan Canyon. 
It's not trivial to tell the difference between Tundra and Trumpeter Swans. In Utah Trumpeter Swans are somewhat rare, but as best as we could tell that's what these are.

A few days later we also saw this large group of swans in the valley.

One afternoon we watched this female kingfisher eat fish from a pond on the edge of the golf course.

The reservoirs in Logan Canyon always have plenty of Barrow's and Common Goldeneyes in the winter (the photo is a Barrow's Goldeneye).
