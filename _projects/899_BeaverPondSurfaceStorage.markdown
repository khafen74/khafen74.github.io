NOTE: This research is ongoing and results are preliminary

<h3>Purpose</h3>
Previous studies have suggested the ability of beaver to positively alter hydrologic patterns with their dam building activity. 
Ponds resulting from beaver dams store water on the land surface and facilitate groundwater recharge by reducing stream velocities and adjusting hydraulic head.
It is believed this additional water storage may supplement streamflow during annual summer droughts, increasing baseflows and providing more water for downstream use.
However, these hypotesized effects have only been observed at small-scales (e.g. 1km stream reaches with 5-10 beaver dams), therefore we do not adequately understand the effect of beaver dams on hydrology at scales meaningful to water management
The purpose of this study is to quantify the the potential effects beaver dams may have on water storage and water delivery at watershed scales.

<h3>Methods</h3>
Using the [Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool](http://brat.joewheaton.org/) (BRAT) I am able to determine the maximum number of beaver dams a stream reach can support. 
I am developing a spatially explicity model to determine the inundation extent and pond volume of a beaver dam with given height at a specific location. 
With estimates of inundation extents and water surface elevations I can then use MODFLOW to determine the change in groundwater levels associated with beaver pond construction. 
Ideally, we will use 10 meter DEMs as inputs as they are nationally available. 
For development of the model we are also using 1m LiDAR DEMs in certain locations.
